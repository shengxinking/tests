DPDK branch and tag:
Setup: a laptop with 100M NIC connected with cross cable to Intel e1000 (4 cores)
Goal: as many as possible connections with as low as possible CPU load
1. 300 connections: laptop - single process
DPDK: 9-10%
Linux: 12 user process (both user & kernel) + 4% soft interrupts
Ping times: 
DPDK: ~130ms
Linux: ~220ms
2. 1000 connections: laptop - signle process
DPDK - ~20%
Linux ~27%
Ping times: the same
3. 5000+ connections, laptop - 9 processes (4x300 + 5x1000), Linux - 4 processes
DPDK: after 300 connections CPU load grows to about 20%, then drops back to about 12%. The reached number
of connections: ~5600 (probably limitation at the laptop's side)
Linux: After about 1000 connections, the CPU load grows sharply and gets to ~90% at each core,
the number of connections reached: ~4500
Ping times: 
DPDK: 130-150ms
Linux: ~250ms
